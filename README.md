# LandOrg - Waste Management Blockchain Project

This is an open-source blockchain project named LandOrg that combines AI and blockchain technology to address solid waste management. The project aims to develop a mobile application that facilitates waste segregation, digital image processing, blockchain minting, and vermicompost production. The ecosystem encourages sustainable practices, local consumption, and financial stability for various stakeholders.

## Project Overview

The waste management process involves the following steps:

1. **Waste Segregation:** Individuals segregate waste into organic and inorganic categories.

2. **Mobile Application:** A React Native mobile application is developed with the following features:
   - Digital image processing and AI are used to detect the authenticity of waste pictures.
   - Only one person can capture a picture to maintain integrity.

3. **Blockchain Minting:** Authenticated waste images are minted on the blockchain, and individuals earn coins based on the submitted images.

4. **Waste Collection:** Dedicated waste collectors transport the segregated waste to a processing facility.

5. **Vermicompost Production:** At the processing facility, the organic waste is processed using earthworms (Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellis) in a controlled environment to create vermicompost.

6. **Organic Farming:** The vermicompost is sold to certified organic farms, enriching the soil with organic matter and promoting sustainable farming practices.

7. **Local Consumption:** Partner farms set up local stalls where consumers in the network can purchase products at discounted rates, promoting locally grown and consumed goods.

## Key Advantages

### For the Common Person:

1. **Awareness and Impact:** The project raises awareness about recycling and waste management, contributing to a positive social and psychological impact on society.

2. **Improved Waste Management:** Encouraging waste segregation reduces improper disposal and promotes a cleaner environment.

3. **Relief for Local Government:** Effective waste management reduces the burden on local governments, allowing them to focus on other critical areas.

4. **Financial Benefits:** Individuals receive discounted products, providing financial benefits and incentives for active participation.

### For Farmers:

1. **Soil Health Improvement:** Farmers contribute to increasing the organic matter in the soil, addressing the decline caused by modern farming practices.

2. **Positive Consumer Impact:** By growing products that positively impact consumers, farmers create a mutually beneficial relationship.

3. **Direct Sales and Financial Stability:** Selling products locally eliminates third-party intervention, allowing farmers to earn higher profits and achieve financial stability.

4. **Social Impact:** The project fosters social awareness and brings about a positive change in the farming community.

### For Waste Collectors and Vermicompost Processors:

1. **Employment Opportunities:** The project creates new employment opportunities, promoting financial stability and improving livelihoods.
